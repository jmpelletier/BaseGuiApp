# BaseGuiApp
This is a simple starter template for creating projects using Dear ImGui.

## Visual Studio
This project uses CMAKE. On new versions of Visual Studio (2019 and above) you can just open the root folder and the IDE will take care of everything. The CMAKE script will automatically download ImGui and other dependencies for you.
